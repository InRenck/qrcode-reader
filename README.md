## QR Code Reader

# Overview
This QR Code Reader is a simple web application that utilizes the HTML5 Qrcode library to scan QR codes using the device's camera. The application displays the camera feed with a designated area for QR code scanning. Once a QR code is successfully scanned, it shows the result and provides a clickable link to the scanned content.

# Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:
 - HTML file (index.html):
   Defines the structure of the QR code reader application, including the container for the camera feed and the result display.
 - JavaScript code within HTML (<script> section):
   Initializes the QR code scanner using the HTML5 Qrcode library.
   Defines success and error functions for handling QR code scanning results.
   Renders the scanner with the specified configuration.
 - CSS file (style.css):
   Provides styles for the QR code reader application, including the layout of the main container, dimensions of the QR code reader area, and styles for the result display.
- QR Code Scanner Library (html5-qrcode.min.js):
  The library responsible for enabling QR code scanning functionality.

# Usage 
To use the QR code reader application, follow these steps:
  1. Include the necessary dependencies:
     npm install html5-qrcode
  2. Clone the repository:
     git clone <repository-url>
  3. Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.
  4. Allow the application to access your camera when prompted.
  5. Position a QR code within the designated area to scan it.
  6. Once a QR code is successfully scanned, the result will be displayed with a clickable link.

# CSS Styles
The CSS styles aim to create a clean and centered layout for the QR code reader application. Key styles include:
  - Main Container:
    The main container uses flexbox to center the content both horizontally and vertically.
  - QR Code Reader Area (#reader):
    The QR code reader area has a specified width (600px) to ensure a consistent scanning area.
  - Result Display (#result):
    The result display area is centered, and the font size is increased for better visibility.

# JavaScript Logic
The JavaScript code initializes the QR code scanner using the HTML5 Qrcode library. It configures the scanning area dimensions, frames per second (fps), and renders the scanner in the designated HTML element (#reader). The success and error functions handle the result of QR code scanning.
